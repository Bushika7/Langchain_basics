Recurrent neural networks have long been used in sequence modeling, but a new model called the Transformer,
 which relies on attention mechanisms instead of recurrence,has shown significant improvements in
 translation quality and parallelization efficiency.


The article explores the evolution of sequence modeling techniques,
highlighting the limitations of recurrent neural networks and the
introduction of the Transformer model architecture to address these
constraints and achieve superior results in translation quality and training efficiency.
